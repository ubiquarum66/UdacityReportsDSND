### Report and Homework Project 1

1. Installations

The jupyter notebook for Project 1 is called udacity_dsnd_report1.ipynb.
It is tested to run with Python 3.7 and Anaconda with installed packages Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

For debugging purpose, c.csv is a excerpt of survey_results_public.csv with only a few lines.

Pictures shown in the jupyter inline matplotlib will be saved as png files during running.

2. Project Motivation

The Notebook represents the Project 1 of Data Science Nanodegree Course. It's output and interpretation can be dfound at [my GitHub Blog Page](https://ubiquarum66.github.io/).

3. File Descriptions

+ survey_results_public.csv : 2017 Stack Overflow user survey
+ survey_results_schema.csv : 2017 schema questions and categories of survey

4. How to Interact with your project

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

For establishing the Github Blog Post, I have to thank Barry Clark for his Jekyll Now explanations and templates.
Google and Stackoverflow -- as usual -- helped enormeosly to find -- for me -- tricky Python hacks.
